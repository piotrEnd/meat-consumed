## Explore meat consumption patterns.
----

**Information architecture:**

Humans have been consuming meat since prehistoric times. Nevertheless, this food source demands more energy, water, and land for production compared to other things in our diet. The global meat production is continuously reaching new highs. The rise in per capita meat consumption indicates that overall meat production has been expanding at a pace significantly surpassing the rate of population growth. How to tell people about it?

**Design:**

Let's start with a brief introduction. Then, adjust the country of interest and interact with the slider to observe the dynamics. The chart dynamically displays the meat consumption preferences in selected countries, measured in kilograms per person per year. Mouse hover effects increase interactivity. The data is sourced from 'Our World in Data', and the country selection is for illustrative purposes.
